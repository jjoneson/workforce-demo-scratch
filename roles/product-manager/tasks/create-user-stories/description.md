You will be given a sequence, then, for each relevant service create a User Story and an API Design. Expand upon details when necessary.

Only create stories for services that are in the sequence diagram.  If a service is not in the sequence diagram, then it is not relevant to the user journey.

A user story has a description and a set of acceptance criteria.

At the end of each user story, create a list of direct service dependencies.  This list of service dependencies will be used to decide which apis to create first.

- A Business Description in an XML tag <businessDescription>
- A Sequence Diagram in an XML tag <sequenceDiagram>
- A Domain Architecture in an XML tag <domainArchitecture>
- A Software Architecture in an XML tag <softwareArchitecture>

Please provide your response as two sets of XML tags <story> and <apiDesign>.  Provide designs for multiple APIs if necessary.  Here are some examples:
