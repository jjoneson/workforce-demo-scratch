Take a Business Description, User Journey, a Sequence Diagram, and a List of Services, then, for each relevant service create a user story. Expand upon details when necessary.

Only create stories for services that are in the sequence diagram.  If a service is not in the sequence diagram, then it is not relevant to the user journey.

A user story has a description and a set of acceptance criteria.  The story is scoped to the role that one service plays in a user journey.  Include a reference to the User Journey.

Only use services that are in the list of Existing Services.  Use spaces in names of services.  For example, use "Order API" instead of "OrderAPI", even if it is "OrderAPI" in the sequence diagram.

At the end of each user story, create a list of direct service dependencies.  This list of service dependencies will be used to decide which apis to create first.
