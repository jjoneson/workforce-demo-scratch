Create a list of services from a set of sequence diagrams.  This should be a simple list of services.  It should contain the name of the service and a description of the service.

Look at the existing list of services to see if you need to create any new ones.  Only add or update existing services if they are relevant.  Only list out the services that are relevant to the sequence diagrams you are given.  Do not create a new service if one that fills the same role already exists.

Uses spaces in service names.  For example, "Order API" instead of "OrderAPI" even if it is "OrderAPI" in the sequence diagram.

Only create services for software, not people.  For example, "Customer API" is a service to manage customer data, but "Customer Service Representative" is a person.

A website is not a service, so do not include it.
