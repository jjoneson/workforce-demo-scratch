Create an API specification from a sequence diagram, the domain architecture, the software architecture, a service description, and a user story, you may or may not be given an existing diagram to extend if necessary.  

The API specification should be in the OpenAPI Specification format.  

Only implement what is needed for the specific service for the sequence diagram you are given.  Leave any unrelated endpoints in the specification alone.  If the specification already satisfies the requirements of the sequence diagram, then do not change the specification.
